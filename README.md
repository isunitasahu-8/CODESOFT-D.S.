# CODESOFT-D.S.
This repository contains all my covered and completed projects assigned by Codesoft during my internship as a Data Scientist Intern.
Here is the breakdown of each project task along with its purpose, content, and strategies/techniques used:
<br><br>
Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
<br><br>
Purpose:<br>
Predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various attributes.
<br><br>
Content:<br>
Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
<br>
<br>
Analyze dataset features (e.g., age, sex, class, fare).
<br>
Handle missing data and outliers.
<br>
Engineer features (e.g., family size, title extraction).
<br>
Model Selection and Training:

Choose classification models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression).
Train models on the Titanic dataset.
Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall.
Evaluation and Conclusion:

Compare models and select the best-performing one.
Discuss insights into survival factors (e.g., gender, class).


Summarize findings and propose future improvements.
Strategy and Techniques:
Techniques: Data imputation, feature engineering (e.g., creating new features from existing ones), classification algorithms.
Strategies: Cross-validation for model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, ensemble methods (if applicable), visualization of results (e.g., confusion matrix).
